let name;         //declared using let
name = "Sam";     //assigned value
name = "David";   //reassigned (allowed with let)

let age = 25;     //declared and initialized

var city = "Chennai";  //declared and initialized with var
var city = "Delhi";    //redeclared using var (allowed with var)



slice , splice


closure ==> inner function can still use outer function's variable even after outer is finished
ex:  
  function outer(){
        let  name = "SAM"

          function inner(){
            console.log(name)
            }
          return inner;
  }
  const greets = outer();
  greets()
==>output=>SAM
